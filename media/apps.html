      <p>
        The Web platform is under constant evolution. Device implementations and application developers need to share a common understanding of the functionalities that the platform offers at any given point in time, and of recommended guidance to use these powerful features.

        <p data-feature="Common baseline of the Web platform">The Web Media API Community Group, created under the aegis of the <a href="https://standards.cta.tech/kwspub/wave/">CTA WAVE project</a>, develops the <a data-featureid="webmediaapi">Web Media APIs</a> document, that defines a common baseline of Web technologies that should be included in device implementations to support media Web applications. This document provides an annual snapshot of the Web platform that developers can rely on being supported across devices when they develop media applications.</p>
        <p data-feature="Media Web applications Best Practices">The Community Group also develops the <a data-featureid="webmediaguidelines">Web Media Application Developer Guidelines</a> document, a companion guide to the Web Media APIs specification that outlines best practices and developer guidance for implementing Web media applications.</p>
